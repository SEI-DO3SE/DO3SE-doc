abstract = {The DO 3SE (Deposition of O 3 for Stomatal Exchange) model is an established tool for estimating ozone (O 3) deposition, stomatal flux and impacts to a variety of vegetation types across Europe. It has been embedded within the EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) photochemical model to provide a policy tool capable of relating the flux-based risk of vegetation damage to O 3 precursor emission scenarios for use in policy formulation. A key limitation of regional flux-based risk assessments has been the assumption that soil water deficits are not limiting O 3 flux due to the unavailability of evaluated methods for modelling soil water deficits and their influence on stomatal conductance (g sto), and subsequent O 3 flux. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a method to estimate soil moisture status and its influence on gsto for a variety of forest tree species. This DO 3SE soil moisture module uses the Penman-Monteith energy balance method to drive water cycling through the soil-plant-atmosphere system and empirical data describing g sto relationships with pre-dawn leaf water status to estimate the biological control of transpiration. We trial four different methods to estimate this biological control of the transpiration stream, which vary from simple methods that relate soil water content or potential directly to g sto, to more complex methods that incorporate hydraulic resistance and plant capacitance that control water flow through the plant system. These methods are evaluated against field data describing a variety of soil water variables, g sto and transpiration data for Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), birch (Betula pendula), aspen (Populus tremuloides), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and holm oak (Quercus ilex) collected from ten sites across Europe and North America. Modelled estimates of these variables show consistency with observed data when applying the simple empirical methods, with the timing and magnitude of soil drying events being captured well across all sites and reductions in transpiration with the onset of drought being predicted with reasonable accuracy. The more complex methods, which incorporate hydraulic resistance and plant capacitance, perform less well, with predicted drying cycles consistently underestimating the rate and magnitude of water loss from the soil. A sensitivity analysis showed that model performance was strongly dependent upon the local parameterisation of key model drivers such as the maximum g sto, soil texture, root depth and leaf area index. The results suggest that the simple modelling methods that relate g sto directly to soil water content and potential provide adequate estimates of soil moisture and influence on g sto such that they are suitable to be used to assess the potential risk posed by O 3 to forest trees across Europe. © 2012 Author(s).},

A model predicting stomatal conductance and its contribution to the control of photosynthesis under different environmental conditions. In: Biggens, J. (Ed.), Progress in Photosynthesis Research, vol. IV. Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, pp. 221-224.] algorithm for calculating stomatal conductance (gs) at the leaf level have been parameterised for two crop and two tree species to test their use in regional scale ozone deposition modelling. The algorithms were tested against measured, site-specific data for durum wheat, grapevine, beech and birch of different European provenances. A direct comparison of both algorithms showed a similar performance in predicting hourly means and daily time-courses of gs, whereas the multiplicative algorithm outperformed the BWB-type algorithm in modelling seasonal time-courses due to the inclusion of a phenology function. The re-parameterisation of the algorithms for local conditions in order to validate ozone deposition modelling on a European scale reveals the higher input requirements of the BWB-type algorithm as compared to the multiplicative algorithm because of the need of the former to model net photosynthesis (An). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Emberson2001,
abstract = {A new dry deposition module has been developed for European-scale mapping and modelling of ozone deposition fluxes (Emberson et al., 2000a,b). The module is being implemented in the photochemical long-range transport model of EMEP that is currently used to estimate exceedance of the existing critical levels for ozone within the UN ECE LRTAP programme. The deposition model evaluates the atmospheric, boundary layer and surface resistances to ozone transfer with the calculation of the dry deposition velocity performed according to a standard resistance formulation. The approach differs from other existing methods through the use of a detailed stomatal uptake model that describes stomatal conductance as a function of plant species, phenology and four environmental variables (air temperature, solar radiation, water vapour pressure deficit and soil moisture deficit). Comparison of preliminary model outputs for selected land-cover types indicate that the model is capable of predicting the seasonal and diurnal range in deposition velocities that have been reported previously in the literature. The application of this deposition scheme enables calculations of ambient ozone concentrations to be made using a biologically based method that can distinguish stomatal and non-stomatal components of total ozone deposition. The ability to estimate stomatal ozone fluxes (according to vegetation type, phenology and spatial location) that are consistent with evaluations of atmospheric ozone concentrations will be helpful in future assessments of ozone impacts to vegetation.},

abstract = {Measurements of total and diffuse, solar and visible (photosynthetically active, PAR) irradiance were made during portions of the summer months of 1979, 1980, and 1981 near Scottsbluff, NE. The objective of this experiment was to obtain equations to predict direct beam and diffuse irradiance in both the visible (PAR) and near-infrared wave bands from measurements of only the total incoming solar radiation. Relationships for potential values of direct and diffuse, visible and near-infrared radiation were established from “clear day” experimental data. Estimates of total visible (PAR) and near-infrared radiation were made by partitioning the measurement of solar radiation using estimates of potential visible and potential near-infrared radiation. Estimates of direct components in the visible and near-infrared were made with relationships developed from the experimental data. There was good agreement between predicted and measured values of the various components of solar radiation. In addition, a correction term for the measurement of diffuse solar radiation with a silicon cell pyranometer was developed.},
